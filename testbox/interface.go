// TestingT is a subset of the testing.T interface that allows tests to run in either a real test
// context, or a mock test scope that is decoupled from the regular testing framework (SandboxTest).
//
// This may be useful in a scenario where you have a contract test that verifies the behavior of some
// unknown interface implementation. In order to verify that the contract test is reliable, you could
// create implementations that either adhere to the contract or deliberately break it, run the contract
// test against those, and verify that the test fails if and only if it should fail.
//
// The reason this cannot be done with the Go testing package alone is that the standard testing.T type
// cannot be created from within test code; instances are always passed in from the test framework.
// Therefore, the contract test would have to be run against the actual *testing.T instance that
// belongs to the test-of-the-test, and if it failed in a situation when we actually wanted it to
// to fail, that would be incorrectly reported as a failure of the test-of-the-test.
//
// To work around this limitation of the testing package, this package provides a TestingT interface
// that has two implementations: real and mock. Test logic can then be written against this TestingT,
// rather than *testing.T.
//
//     func RunContractTests(t *testing.T, impl InterfaceUnderTest) {
//         runContractTests(testbox.RealTest(t))
//     }

//     func runContractTests(abstractT testbox.TestingT, impl InterfaceUnderTest) {
//         assert.True(abstractT, impl.SomeConditionThatShouldBeTrueForTheseInputs(someParams))
//         abstractT.Run("subtest", func(abstractSubT helpers.TestingT) { ... }
//     }
//
//     func TestContractTestFailureCondition(t *testing.T) {
//         impl := createDeliberatelyBrokenImplementation()
//         result := testbox.SandboxTest(func(abstractT testbox.TestingT) {
//             runContractTests(abstractT, impl) })
//         assert.True(t, result.Failed // we expect it to fail
//         assert.Len(t, result.Failures, 1)

// TestingT includes the same subsets of testing.T methods that are defined in the TestingT interfaces
// of github.com/stretchr/testify/assert and github.com/stretchr/testify/require, so all assertions in
// those packages will work. It also provides Run, Skip, and SkipNow. It does not support Parallel.

	// instead of *testing.T.
	//
	// If the subtest fails, the parent test also fails, but FailNow and SkipNow on the subtest do not
	// cause the parent test to exit early.
