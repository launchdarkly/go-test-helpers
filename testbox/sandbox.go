// of the regular test framework (assuming that this code is even executing within a Go test; it does
// not have to be).
//
// The reason this uses a callback function parameter, rather than simply having the SandboxResult
// implement TestingT itself, is that the function must be run on a separate goroutine so that
// the sandbox can intercept any early exits from FailNow or SkipNow.
//
// SandboxTest does not recover from panics.
